      "question": "An LED is used in",
      "answers": {
        "a": "An unbiased state",
        "b": "Forward or reverse bias",
        "c": "Reverse bias",
        "d": "Forward bias"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. No current flows in unbiased state.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Only forward bias allows LED to emit light.",
        "c": "Incorrect. LED does not emit light in reverse bias.",
        "d": "Correct. LED emits light when forward biased."

      "question": "Which one of the following is a forced vibration?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Vibration of a building during earthquake",
        "b": "Pulling a child back on a swing",
        "c": "Mass suspended on a stretched string",
        "d": "Hitting a tuning fork"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Earthquakes induce external vibrationsâ€”forced vibration.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This initiates free vibration.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This describes natural vibration.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This produces free vibration after the hit."

        "a": "Vibration",
        "b": "Resonance",
        "c": "Reverberation",
        "d": "The angle of incidence is less than the angle of refraction"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Vibration refers to mechanical oscillation around an equilibrium.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Resonance is a specific condition of vibration.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Reverberation is a sound phenomenon.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is related to optics, not mechanical oscillation."
